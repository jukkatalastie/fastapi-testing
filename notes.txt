09:38:05 for the vote model and new pydantic updates, it can be done in the following way,

make sure to import these:

from typing import Annotated
from pydantic import Field

class Vote(BaseModel):
          post_id: int
          dir: Annotated[int, Field(ge=0, le=1)]


According to pydantic, conint returns a new type which cause issues with static type checkers, while, Annotated allows to add metadata (like constraints) to existing types, thus making it more type-safe and clear. 

Field(ge=0, le=1): this specifies that dir must be greater than or equal to 0 (inclusive), and less than or equal to 1 (inclusive).

Cheers
